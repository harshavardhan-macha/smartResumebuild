Smart Resume Builder is a modern web application designed to help users create professional, impactful resumes easily. With an intuitive step-by-step form, users can enter all necessary resume details including personal info, education, experience, skills, and projects.

Before saving, the app uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 (free tier) to analyze the input and suggest improvements for resume content such as summaries, project descriptions, and more â€” making the resume recruiter-ready.

Users can choose from different resume templates, preview the final design, and download their resume as a PDF. All resumes are stored and can be accessed later for editing or exporting.

Built with React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and OpenAI API, this project blends clean design, real-time validation, and smart automation into one powerful resume creation platform.
